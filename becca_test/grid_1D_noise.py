"""
One-dimensional grid task with noise

In this task, the agent has the challenge of discriminating between
actual informative state sensors, and a comparatively large number
of sensors that are pure noise distractors. Many learning methods
make the implicit assumption that all sensors are informative.
This task is intended to break them.
