"""
A task in which an robot must choose between ripe and unripe fruit.

In this task, the robot's sensors tell it whether a fruit is either
1) small or large and
2) yellow or purple.
A small yellow fruit is an unripe plum. It is not good to eat.
A small purple fruit is a ripe plum. It is good to eat.
A large yellow fruit is a ripe peach. It is good to eat.
A large purple fruit is a rotten peach. It is not good to eat.

To succeed in this task, the robot has to consider the combination
of its sensors, rather than each one individually. This is
mathematically related to the XOR task, a challenge for
many machine learning algorithms.
